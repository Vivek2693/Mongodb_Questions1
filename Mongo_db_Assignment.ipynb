    "### Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "A1. MongoDB is a popular open-source NoS### QL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is a document-oriented database, meaning it stores data in collections of JSON-like documents rather than in tables with rows and columns like traditional SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoS### QL databases, differ from traditional S### QL databases in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "They do not re### Quire a fixed schema, allowing for flexibility in data representation.\n",
    "They can handle semi-structured and unstructured data more efficiently.\n",
    "They often provide horizontal scalability, allowing for easy scaling across multiple servers.\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over S### QL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility in schema design is re### Quired, such as with rapidly evolving data models.\n",
    "Scalability and performance are crucial, especially for handling large volumes of unstructured data.\n",
    "Agile development methodologies are used, where fre### Quent changes to the data model are common.\n",
    "### Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "A2. MongoDB offers several features that make it a popular choice for modern applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-Oriented: Data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON).\n",
    "Ad Hoc ### Queries: MongoDB supports dynamic  Queries on documents using a rich ### Query language.\n",
    "Indexing: Indexes can be created to improve  Query performance.\n",
    "Replication: MongoDB provides high availability through replica sets, which maintain multiple copies of data across different servers.\n",
    "Horizontal Scalability: It supports sharding, allowing data to be distributed across multiple servers for horizontal scaling.\n",
    "Aggregation: MongoDB provides powerful aggregation framework for data aggregation and analysis.\n",
    "Schema-less: It allows for dynamic and flexible schema design, accommodating changes to data structures without downtime.\n",
    "GridFS: MongoDB can store large files and binary data with GridFS, which divides files into smaller chunks for efficient storage and retrieval."
